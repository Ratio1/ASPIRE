# AGENTS.md

Purpose: This file is the living memory for this repo. Keep it short, factual, and updated.

Update rules:
- After each non-trivial task, add a bullet to Progress Log.
- When you learn or change an architectural or integration detail, add it under the relevant notes.
- When you ask the user a question or need follow-up, add it to Open Questions and remove/mark resolved once answered.
- Do not record secrets or sensitive data.

## Project Snapshot
- Next.js App Router prototype for Aspire - Archicava Case Inference Studio.
- Live mode uses Ratio1 Edge Node services.

## Architecture Notes
- Case and job data flows through `lib/data-platform.ts` and the Ratio1 SDK.
- Ratio1 Edge SDK client is created in `lib/ratio1-client.ts` (CStore/R1FS + peers).
- Data keys: `platformConfig.casesHKey` and `platformConfig.jobsHKey`.

## Auth & Security Notes
- Live auth uses `@ratio1/cstore-auth-ts` in `lib/auth/cstore.ts` (`simple.init()` + `simple.authenticate()`).
- Session cookie is signed (HMAC) in `r1-session` (see `lib/auth/session.ts`); set `AUTH_SESSION_SECRET` in prod.
- Auth UI caches sessions in `aspire-session` localStorage for client-side reloads.
- Authenticated pages gate via `useAuth` in `app/(authenticated)/layout.tsx`; admin APIs validate the session cookie.

## Env Vars
- `R1EN_CHAINSTORE_API_URL` / `R1EN_R1FS_API_URL` set endpoints; `R1EN_CHAINSTORE_PEERS` optional.
- `R1EN_CSTORE_AUTH_HKEY`, `R1EN_CSTORE_AUTH_SECRET`, `R1EN_CSTORE_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PWD` (legacy: `EE_CSTORE_AUTH_HKEY`, `EE_CSTORE_AUTH_SECRET`, `EE_CSTORE_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PW`) for CStore auth.
- `AUTH_SESSION_SECRET` is required in production for signed sessions.
- `AUTH_SESSION_COOKIE`, `AUTH_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` override session cookie settings.
